# 🤖 Robot Charging Station Mini Program

> A robot charging and status management WeChat Mini Program built with  
> **uni-app + Vue 3 + uniCloud (Alibaba Cloud)**.  
>  
> The system supports robot status monitoring, telemetry inspection, fault management,  
> and remote control command dispatch.  
>  
> The project follows a **platform-first, device-later** architecture, enabling seamless
> integration with real robots in the future (4G / HTTP / MQTT).

## 📌 Project Background

This project aims to build a **remote management platform for real-world robots** using a
WeChat Mini Program.

Core capabilities include:
- Displaying robot operational status and battery information
- Viewing telemetry and fault records
- Issuing remote control commands to robots

Since the physical robot hardware is not yet finalized, the project prioritizes:
- Overall platform architecture design
- Backend service APIs and database modeling
- Strict frontend–backend decoupling through standardized interfaces

This ensures that **real robot integration can be completed later without refactoring the existing system**.

🚀 Development Phases
Phase 1: Project Skeleton & UI Structure

Initialized uni-app + WeChat Mini Program project

Built core page structure (robot list, detail, control sections)

Defined core functional requirements and data presentation layout

Phase 2: Cloud Database Design & Initialization ✅

Goal: Build a stable and extensible data model.

Completed work:

Designed and created four core collections:

robots: robot base information

telemetry_latest: latest telemetry per robot

faults: fault records

commands: control command records

Added necessary indexes (including unique and composite indexes)

Inserted initial mock data

Verified data queries and relationships using JQL

Phase 2 ensures the data model is production-ready before real robot integration.

Phase 3: Backend Service Layer (Cloud Functions) ✅

Phase 3 is a key milestone of this project.

🎯 Objectives

Establish a stable business service layer between frontend and database

Encapsulate all database access logic

Implement parameter validation, error handling, and safety constraints

Define a unified API contract for future real robot integration

🧩 robot-service Cloud Function

A single cloud function provides all backend APIs, dispatched via the action parameter.

1️⃣ robotList

Purpose: Retrieve robot list with latest telemetry and fault count.

{
  "action": "robotList"
}


Returns:

Robot base information

Latest telemetry data

Fault count statistics

2️⃣ robotDetail

Purpose: Retrieve detailed information for a single robot.

{
  "action": "robotDetail",
  "robotCode": "ROBOT-001"
}


Returns:

Robot base information

Latest telemetry data

Most recent fault records (latest 20, ordered by time)

Error handling:

Explicit error response if robotCode does not exist

3️⃣ commandCreate

Purpose: Create and dispatch a control command.

{
  "action": "commandCreate",
  "robotCode": "ROBOT-001",
  "type": "move",
  "payload": {
    "direction": "forward"
  }
}


Features:

Parameter validation

Robot existence verification

500ms command throttling to prevent command flooding

Writes to commands collection with initial status pending

✅ Phase 3 Acceptance Summary

All backend APIs execute successfully in uniCloud

Unified response structure { code, data | message }

Parameter validation and error handling verified

Command throttling works as expected

No uncaught runtime errors in cloud function logs

Phase 3 is fully validated and ready for real robot integration.

🧠 Architecture Overview

The system adopts a decoupled, layered architecture:

WeChat Mini Program (Frontend)
        ↓
Phase 3 Cloud Functions (robot-service)
        ↓
Cloud Database (robots / telemetry / faults / commands)
        ↑
Future Real Robots (4G / HTTP / MQTT)

Design Advantages

Frontend is completely decoupled from device implementation

Robot communication protocols can be replaced or extended

Backend APIs serve as a stable contract

Architecture aligns with real-world industrial control systems

🔮 Future Plans

Phase 4: Frontend integration with cloud APIs

Phase 5: Real robot connectivity (4G / HTTP / MQTT)

Web-based admin management platform

Authentication and permission system

✍️ Notes

This project completes platform and backend design before hardware availability.
When real robots are ready, only the device data upload and command execution logic
needs to be implemented—no system redesign required.
