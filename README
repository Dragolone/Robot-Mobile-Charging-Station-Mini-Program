Robot Mobile Charging Station Mini Program

A WeChat Mini Program for monitoring and controlling mobile robot charging stations, built with uni-app (Vue3) and uniCloud (Alibaba Cloud).
This project is designed to support mock development → cloud-based simulation → real robot integration with minimal changes to frontend logic.

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: uni-app + Vue 3 (<script setup>)

Cloud Backend: uniCloud (Alibaba Cloud)

Database: uniCloud Cloud Database

Platform: WeChat Mini Program

Architecture Goal: Frontend–Backend decoupled, device-agnostic integration

✅ Current Status
Phase 2 Completed: Database Setup & Deployment ✅

The database layer has been fully initialized and deployed to uniCloud (Alibaba Cloud).

What has been completed:

✅ Cloud database collections created

✅ Database schemas defined and deployed

✅ Initial test data inserted

✅ Queries verified successfully in uniCloud console

Current collections:

Collection Name	Purpose
robots	Robot base information (robotCode, model, status)
telemetry_latest	Latest telemetry per robot (battery, position, online)
faults	Fault and error records
commands	Control command records (move / stop / goto)

This database structure simulates real robot telemetry and command flow, even before physical devices are available.
